Compiler structure: 
Main method, reads each line and performs the translation per line. 
Reads what function it is; Functions.cpp contains all different functions and runs method. 
Each method returns the resulting binary for the function. 
Once all binary is written go through and conver to hex. Hex conversion takes place line by line using
conversion method in Functions.cpp
